I have successfully added two Instagram accounts. You can now view the list of all the accounts.

## Create a Post
To replicate a post, follow these steps:
  1. Copy the link of a public account post (e.g., https://www.instagram.com/p/CuFPg1IPQf8/).
  2. Select the user whose account you want to use to create the post.
  3. Click "Submit."

## Like Post related to a Hashtag 
To enhance account engagement, you can like posts related to a specific hashtag.

Follow these steps, which are similar to the ones described for creating a post:
  1. Select the user accounts
  2. Enter the hashtag name
  3. Specify the number of posts you want the account to like.

| Submit Detials                                                   | Like of selected user(ranuv0803)                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ![Screenshot from 2023-07-04 13-09-52](https://github.com/Shanu85/InstaAutoShare/assets/63155782/86de77ca-9e05-4b43-8aea-5e940cf86a98) | ![Screenshot from 2023-07-04 13-16-42](https://github.com/Shanu85/InstaAutoShare/assets/63155782/26ff12c1-9b8d-4b01-b425-edb3151353f7) |

As we can in 'Like of selected user(ranuv0803)' , the code will create like 5 posts that are related to the hashtag 'space'. 

## Send Follow Request
You can simultaneously send follow requests to an account from multiple selected accounts. 

Enter the username of the account to which you want to send the follow request.
